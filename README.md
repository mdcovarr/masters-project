#### Method
* Visual Stimulus were two faces: face and scrambled face.
* 2 sets of 300 grayscale photographs
* 2 photographs for each face
* 1 for M/EEG Session
* 1 for fMRI Session
* Scrambled face was generated from either famous or non-famous face
of the same stimuli number.

After M/EEG acquisition, participants saw each of the 300 faces again.
(1) they had not seen the face before the experiment
(2) the face looked familiar, but they could not remember from where
(3) they knew the face i.e. could remember definite fact about them, such as their job, a movie they were in, their name etc.

73% of  famous faces were given a rating of 2-3
86% of nonfamous faces were given a rating of 1

#### Goal
* To predict the category of a visual stimulus presented to a subject
from the concurrent brain activity.

#### Background and Aim
Social Anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common psychiatric disorder.
Internet-Based congnitive behavior therapy (iCBT) is effective against SAD.

* 44 Participants
* Structural neuroimaging was performed before and after
treatment and at a 1-year follow-up.
* The study examined long-term effects of Internet-delivered CBT both
on structural and functional neuroplasticity 1 year after treatment

#### Method
* Self reported questionnaires and to partake in a clinical interview via
telephone. A subset of these participants accepted to undergo an
additional MRI
* Therapist-guided Internet-delivered CBT with weekly online support form a
psychologist.

#### Goals
* Longitudinal intervention studies with Gray Matter (GM) and neuroimaging
studies of brain plasticity over the long-term may open new avenues in understanding mental disorder

* Hoped to find reduction of amygdala GM volume. Responders, relative
to non-responders, had significantly greater reduction in left amygdala
CM volume grom pretreatment to 1-year follow-up.
